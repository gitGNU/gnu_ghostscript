This is GNU Ghostscript version 8.16.

GNU Ghostscript is an interpreter for the Postscript language and the
Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), a set of C procedures (the
Ghostscript lib) that implements the graphics capabilities that appear
as primitive operations in the Postscript language and in PDF, and a
set of utility programs that include the ability to convert PostScript
to PDF.

The main changes since the last release (8.01) are improved font rendering,
offers significantly better PDF generation and handling over GNU ghostscript
8.01, support for running Ghostscript in job server mode, so that multiple jobs
can be piped to a since executable instance as if it were a printer. Just
invoke gs with the new -dJOBSERVER switch and delimit jobs on stdin with ^D.
See the Usage documentation for more details. Many other bug fixes are also
present.

GNU Ghostscript is based on the GPLed Ghostscript made by Ralph Giles,
artofcode LLC and Artifex Software, Inc.  Thanks to Ralph's hard work
for making this release of Ghostscript possible. Also thanks to Andy Tai
from the GNU project for the hard work on GNU Ghostscript versions before 8.16.
