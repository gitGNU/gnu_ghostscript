<h2><a name="Overview"></a>An overview of Ghostscript</h2>

<p>
Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

<ul>
<li>An interpreter for the <b>PostScript</b><small><sup>TM</sup></small>
language and the Adobe <b>Portable Document Format</b> (<b>PDF</b> --
sometimes confused with Acrobat, Adobe's PDF browser and editor product);

<li>Input modules (utilities) for reading a variety of raster formats,
including <b>CMYK</b>, <b>GIF</b>, <b>JFIF</b> (<b>JPEG</b>), <b>MIFF</b>,
<b>PBM</b>/<b>PGM</b>/<b>PPM</b>, and <b>PCX</b>;

<li>Output modules (drivers) for a wide variety of window systems (including
X Windows and Microsoft Windows), raster file formats, and printers, as well
as a PDF output module that implements functions similar to Adobe's
Acrobat<small><sup>TM</sup></small> Distiller<small><sup>TM</sup></small>
product; and

<li>The Ghostscript library, a set of procedures to implement the graphics
and filtering capabilities that are primitive operations in the PostScript
language and in PDF.
</ul>

<p>
In simple terms, this means that Ghostscript can read a PostScript or PDF
file and display the results on the screen or convert them into a form you
can print on a non-PostScript printer. Especially together with several
popular <a href="#Previewers">previewers</a>, with Ghostscript you can view
or print an entire document or even isolated pages, even if your computer
doesn't have Display PostScript and your printer doesn't handle PostScript
itself.

<h3><a name="Find_Ghostscript"></a>How is Ghostscript licensed?  Where can I find it?</h3>

<p>
Ghostscript is a copyrighted work (artofcode LLC owns the copyright);
it is not shareware or in the public domain.  Different versions of it are
distributed with three different licenses:

<h4><a name="GNU_gs"></a>GNU Ghostscript</h4>

<p>
GNU Ghostscript is distributed under the terms of the GNU <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a>,
which allows free use, and free copying and redistribution under certain
conditions (including, in some cases, commercial distribution).
You can always get the current version of GNU Ghostscript by Internet FTP
from any of the many GNU distribution sites.  The GNU home ftp site is

<blockquote>
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/"
class="offsite">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
For a more complete list of sites, including sites outside the U.S. and
other ways of obtaining GNU software, contact
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>
<a href="mailto:gnu@gnu.org">&lt;gnu@gnu.org&gt;</a>.

<p><a name="CTAN"></a>
Versions of Ghostscript are also available from sites in the
Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN), in a tree based at
/tex-archive/support/ghostscript/, which you can find at these principal
CTAN distribution sites ("participating hosts") as of mid-1998:

<blockquote><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>	<td><a
href="ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/support/ghostscript/"

</table></blockquote>

<p>
CTAN has more than fifty mirror sites around the world.  For information
about CTAN sites, including how to use them over the World Wide Web, visit
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/" class="offsite">ctan.org</a> or get

<h3><a name="Third-party_libraries"></a>Libraries obtained from other parties</h3>

<p>
The Ghostscript source code distribution, and the Ghostscript executable
code, include libraries obtained from other parties.  All the source files
mentioned in this section are in the Ghostscript and third-party library
source kits.  The documentation of <a href="Make.htm">how to build
Ghostscript</a> tells <a href="Make.htm#Acquiring">where to get these
libraries</a> and <a href="Make.htm#Unpack">how to unpack them</a>.

<blockquote><dl>
<dt>The <a href="http://www.ijg.org/" class="offsite">Independent JPEG
Group</a> (IJG)
library
<dd>The executable versions of Ghostscript are based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group.  For more information, see
<b><tt>jpeg.mak</tt></b> in the main Ghostscript source directory and
<b><tt>README</tt></b> in the libjpeg source directory.

<dt>The <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/"
class="offsite">Portable Network
Graphics</a> (PNG) library created by Dave Martindale, Guy Eric Schalnat,
Paul Schmidt, and Tim Wegner, of Group 42, Inc.
<dd>For more information, see <b><tt>libpng.mak</tt></b> in the main
Ghostscript source directory, and <b><tt>README</tt></b> and
<b><tt>png.h</tt></b> in the libpng source directory.

<dt>The <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/"
class="offsite">zlib</a> library
created by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler
<dd>For more information, see <b><tt>zlib.mak</tt></b> in the main
Ghostscript source directory, and <b><tt>README</tt></b> in the
zlib source code.
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
These libraries do not fall under the GPL but come with their own licenses,
which also allow free use and redistribution under appropriate
circumstances and which appear in the files mentioned just above.  These
libraries are entirely original works of their respective authors, and are
provided as is with no warranty and no support.

<hr>

<h3><a name="Support"></a>What if I want support?</h3>

<p>
Neither artofcode LLC nor any organization known to us currently offers
Ghostscript support for end-users -- that is, for people or companies who
just want to use Ghostscript and not redistribute it as part of a product.

<p>
Nothing in the GNU license prevents anyone from providing
support for Ghostscript, either free or commercial.  We would be happy to
include in the Ghostscript documentation the contact information for anyone
who wants to offer such support.

<hr>

<h3><a name="Platforms"></a>What platforms does Ghostscript run on?</h3>

<p>
Ghostscript is written entirely in C, with special care taken to make it
portable to a wide variety of systems. It is actively maintained on many
unix-like operating systems, Microsoft Windows, Apple's MacOS and
OpenVMS and can easily be ported to others. Please see <a
href="Make.htm">Making Ghostscript</a> for details on the build process
and hints for various platforms. 

<hr>

<h2><a name="Related_work"></a>Related work</h2>

<h3><a name="Drivers"></a>Drivers</h3>

<p>
A number of people have created Ghostscript drivers that they prefer to
distribute directly, rather than including them in the Ghostscript
distributions. Please refer to <a
href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/"
class="offsite">www.linuxprinting.org</a> or your favorite search engine
for
relevant examples.

<h3><a name="Previewers"></a>Previewers</h3>

<p>
The Ghostscript user interface is very primitive, so several people have
contributed screen previewers with better user interfaces.

<h4><a name="Previewer_X"></a>Previewers for X Windows</h4>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt>GSPreview</tt></b>
<dd>For information on GSPreview, contact Richard Hesketh
&lt;<a href="mailto:rlh@ukc.ac.uk">rlh@ukc.ac.uk</a>&gt;.

<h4><a name="Previewer_DOS-Win"></a>Previewers for DOS and MS Windows</h4>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt>psv</tt></b>
<dd><b><tt>PSV</tt></b>, another keyboard-based PostScript viewing package
for DOS, appears to be redistributable with no restrictions.  It was once
available from

<blockquote>
ftp://puccini.ujf-grenoble.fr/pub/contrib-ps/DOS-PSV/
</blockquote>
</dl>

<h4><a name="Previewer_GNULinux"></a>A previewer for GNU/Linux</h4>

<dl>
<dt><b><tt>BMV</tt></b> <dd>Jan Kybic has created a Ghostscript-based
bitmap previewing program for GNU/Linux called <b><tt>BMV</tt></b>, which
doesn't use X Windows but is based on <b><tt>svgalib</tt></b>.  He says
there is a port of <b><tt>BMV</tt></b> for SCO Unix by William Bader.
<b><tt>BMV</tt></b> is available from

<dt><b><tt>genscript</tt></b>
<dd><b><tt>genscript</tt></b> is a free replacement for the
<b><tt>enscript</tt></b> program.  <b><tt>genscript</tt></b> converts plain
text files to PostScript and sends the generated PostScript output to the
specified printer or to a file.  <b><tt>genscript</tt></b> can be easily
extended to handle different output media, and it has many options which can
be used to customize printouts, including 2-up printing, pagination, complex
headers, and many more.  You can find the current version at

If you have problems with Ghostscript and you have access to the
Internet, we suggest to post your question to one of these Usenet
newsgroups:

<dl>
<dt><b><tt><a href="news:gnu.ghostscript.bug">gnu.ghostscript.bug</a></tt></b>
<dd>if your question is about <b>GNU Ghostscript</b>.  If you have access to Internet mail, but not Usenet news,
write to <b><tt>bug-ghostscript@gnu.org</tt></b>, which is equivalent to
posting to that newsgroup.

<dt><b><tt><a href="news:comp.lang.postscript">comp.lang.postscript</a></tt></b>
<dd>if you have a general question about Ghostscript. Note
however that this newsgroup was not intended for Ghostscript
discussion <em>per se</em>.

<p>
There are hundreds of Ghostscript user sites all over the world, and another
user will often be able to help you.  If you have trouble with a specific
device driver, look at <b><tt>devs.mak</tt></b> and
<b><tt>contrib.mak</tt></b> in the Ghostscript source directory to see in
which file the driver is defined.  If it's defined in
<b><tt>contrib.mak</tt></b>, the list of contributed drivers, please contact
the author directly: the maintainers of Ghostscript can't help you with
user-maintained drivers.

development of Ghostscript.  Please do not contact us if all you want is
help with Ghostscript!  Ghostscript is
free, but our time is not.  If you call for help, we will tell you politely
that we cannot answer your question.  Ghostscript's documentation, while not
of commercial end-user quality, has been adequate for thousands of users
(for many of whom English is a foreign language), so the answer to your
question is very likely in it somewhere. <!-- ouch -->

<h2><a name="How_to_help"></a>How you can help improve Ghostscript</h2>

<p>
The most valuable thing you can do to help improve Ghostscript is to help
test it.  We make three different grades of release available, each of
which needs a different kind of testing.

<ul>
<li><em>Stable</em> releases are made available about every 9 months, after
a beta test period.  Reporting problems as described <a
href="#Reporting_problems">above</a> often results in a fix being posted on
our Web site.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Beta</em> releases are posted starting about 6 weeks before a
planned public release.  These are candidates for public release, and need
intensive testing.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Development</em> releases are posted every few weeks.  These are not
supposed to be good enough for general use, but testing them is still very
helpful, since it gets problems corrected before the intensive beta test
period.
</ul>

<p>
You can always find the current public release and the current beta or
tester release on our <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Web
site</a>.  If you would like to be notified when new beta or tester releases
are posted, please <a href="#Contacting_us">contact us</a>.

<p>
There are also some useful projects that we don't have enough resources to
work on, and with which we would appreciate help.  See <a
href="Projects.htm">this list</a> for details.
