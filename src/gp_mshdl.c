 * value of the handle.  
 * The typical use is for another program to create a pipe, 
 * pass the write end into Ghostscript using 
 *  -sOutputFile="%handle%NNNNNNNN"
 * so that Ghostscript printer output can be captured by the
 * other program.  The handle would be created with CreatePipe().
 * If Ghostscript is not a DLL, the pipe will have to be inheritable 
 * by the Ghostscript process.
